## Segment 1 
- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**:
    - Due to inconsistent braking and accelerating, the performance rating is 6 out of 10.
- **Assessment**:
    The driver experienced difficulties with cornering and exit speed. In addition, there were some braking issues that led to a slight loss of traction. To improve their overall performance, it's essential for the driver to work on their cornering techniques, particularly during high-speed corners like Turn 1 and Turn 5.

## Segment 2 
- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**:
    - Due to inconsistent throttle control and braking issues, the performance rating is 4 out of 10.
- **Assessment**:
