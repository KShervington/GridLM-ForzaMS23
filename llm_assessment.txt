## Segment 1 
### Analysis for Segment 1 
- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**: 6
- **Assessment**: In Segment 1, your average speeds are slightly below the baseline, indicating room for improvement. Your braking points could be adjusted; initiating braking a bit later can help you maintain higher speeds through the initial corners. Focus on smoother throttle application as you exit, as abrupt changes can lead to loss of speed. Aim to match the baseline average speed of 65.07 km/h by fine-tuning your corner entries and exits.

## Segment 2
### Analysis for Segment 2
- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**: 5
- **Assessment**: In Segment 2, thereï¿½s a notable drop in speed compared to the baseline, particularly in the latter part of the segment. This suggests that your cornering technique may need refinement. Work on maintaining momentum through the corners, especially where your speeds dropped to 58.47 km/h and 53.06 km/h. Late apexing could help you carry more speed onto the straights. Additionally, consider adjusting your braking technique; softer, more gradual braking could lead to faster corner exits. Strive to improve your speeds to match or exceed the baseline of 71.06 km/h.
