- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**: 5
- **Assessment**: Focus on maintaining momentum by optimizing brake pressure and gear shifting. Be aware of the need to adjust throttle input according to changing acceleration requirements. Smooth, consistent inputs are crucial for this segment.

## Segment 4

- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**: 6
- **Assessment**: Leverage higher braking pressures in certain sections to maintain speed. Adjust throttle percentages accordingly to compensate for lower acceleration. Smooth gear shifting and consistent inputs will help optimize performance.

## Segment 5

- **Performance Rating (out of 10)**: 4
- **Assessment**: Be mindful of the need to adjust brake pressure and throttle input according to changing acceleration requirements. Avoid abrupt gear shifts, as this can disrupt momentum. Optimize braking pressures for optimal speed retention.
